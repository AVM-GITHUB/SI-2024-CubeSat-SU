## ESP32+LoRa
   -By integrating ESP32 with LoRa we get a versatile platform capable of connecting to the internet via Wi-Fi while also transmitting data over long distances using LoRa. This makes it ideal for applications like sensor networks, remote monitoring, and other IoT projects where both local and long-range communication are required.
