## Basic Digital Modulation
-Modulation is the process of superimposing high-frequency carrier signals with low-frequency message signals resulting in a modulated wave. In modulation, one of the three parameters of the carrier wave is changed i.e. amplitude, frequency or phase according to the amplitude of the message signal at a given time instant. It is an important technique used to increase the range of communication, increase the signal-to-noise ratio, and decrease the size of the antenna.

In Digital Modulation, only the carrier signal is analogue and the message signal is in digital form.
**Some terms used in Digitial Modulation are :**

**Amplitude Shift Keying  :**

**Frequency Shift Keying  :**
In Frequency Shift Keying (FSK), each symbol in the message signal gives a unique frequency to the carrier wave. There are two types of FSK, Binary and M-ary. In Binary FSK, logic 1 is associated with certain frequency of carrier wave e.g. 50MHz and logic 0 is associated with different frequency other than 50MHz e.g. 25MHz. In M-ary FSK, a group of log2M bits are considered together rather than 1 bit at a time and the frequency is associated with this group of bits.

**Phase Shift Keying  :**
Phase-shift keying is a digital modulation process which conveys data by changing the phase of a constant frequency carrier wave. The modulation is accomplished by varying the sine and cosine inputs at a precise time.

## Introduction ot ESP32 Development Board
## ESP32+LoRa
   -By integrating ESP32 with LoRa we get a versatile platform capable of connecting to the internet via Wi-Fi while also transmitting data over long distances using LoRa. This makes it ideal for applications like sensor networks, remote monitoring, and other IoT projects where both local and long-range communication are required.
