## Basic Digital Modulation
-Modulation is the process of superimposing high-frequency carrier signals with low-frequency message signals resulting in a modulated wave. In modulation, one of the three parameters of the carrier wave is changed i.e. amplitude, frequency or phase according to the amplitude of the message signal at a given time instant. It is an important technique used to increase the range of communication, increase the signal-to-noise ratio, and decrease the size of the antenna.

In Digital Modulation, only the carrier signal is analogue and the message signal is in digital form.

## ESP32+LoRa
   -By integrating ESP32 with LoRa we get a versatile platform capable of connecting to the internet via Wi-Fi while also transmitting data over long distances using LoRa. This makes it ideal for applications like sensor networks, remote monitoring, and other IoT projects where both local and long-range communication are required.
